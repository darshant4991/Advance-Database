# Advance Database

Retail shops help people to fulfil the daily needs of groceries. Tracking such a huge amount 
of data related to products, customers, employees, orders, payments, and suppliers is 
essential for retail shops. Managing all these records on paper is untrustworthy, 
susceptible and sloppy. The motto of our project is to create a rational database to access, 
manage, modify, and update data as per the requirement.

We have worked on a database to support a retail grocery shop to manage their services 
with ease of technology and minimize the errors which can be caused by paper work

Conclusion:
Our database includes everything that a retail shop may require, and integrating them 
would help their organization function even more efficiently. since all necessary 
information is entered into the system that may be retrieved at any moment. Our database 
maintains data integrity as well as data security.
Our database verifies that all information has been provided, but if any information has 
been provided incorrectly, our database should display an alert and refuse to save it in the 
database. We acquired cognitive information of our database prior to establishing it.
Moreover, normalization was required to ensure that now the tables are now in the 3rd NF.
Ultimately. We stayed on track and feel we created a really well database
